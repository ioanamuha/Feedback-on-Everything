Develop a web tool that allows users to provide feedback for a specific "thing" (event, person, geographic location, product, service, artistic artifact, etc.) in an anonymous manner. In this context, feedback is understood to be an emotion specified according to the Plutchik model. The application – via a REST/GraphQL API – must manage the "things" to be evaluated and the specific responses to each (editable by the initiator of a feedback collection request). After the period in which a form is accessible to people who review a specific "thing", statistics of interest will be presented for each category of "things" evaluated according to each emotion recorded -- multiple criteria will be considered such as the user group, the time period of the evaluation, the subcategories of "things", the characteristics considered positive/negative based on the shared emotion, etc. The generated reports will be available in HTML, CSV and JSON formats. Bonus: choosing attractive ways to visualize data (https://profs.info.uaic.ro/andrei.panu/courses/web/lab/hci08-DataVisualization.pdf).
