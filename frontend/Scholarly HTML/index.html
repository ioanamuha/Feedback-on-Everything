                <h3>1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h3>
                <p>
                    This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is tailored for a specific audience involved in the operation 
                    and interaction with the Feedback Collection Tool (FCT). Feedback Providers, the primary users, will find 
                    relevance in sections detailing the user interface and feedback mechanisms, designed to facilitate an intuitive 
                    and confidential sharing experience. Feedback Collection Initiators, who orchestrate the feedback campaigns,
                     are directed towards system features and administrative functionalities that enable the management and curation 
                     of "things" to be evaluated. Page Administrators will prioritize content on system maintenance, user management, 
                     and data integrity, with a keen interest in the operational environment that ensures the smooth running of the FCT. 
                     Specialists and Doctors, responsible for validating responses, will find the reporting and data visualization 
                     features of particular interest, as these sections elucidate the statistical outcomes and emotional analytics 
                     derived from user feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The document is structured to usher each user group to the sections most pertinent to their roles. It commences 
                    with a broad introduction, guiding Feedback Providers to interface layouts and interaction flows. 
                    Feedback Collection Initiators and Page Administrators are advised to consult the system features and external 
                    interface requirements that define their administrative capabilities. Specialists and Doctors will benefit from 
                    the latter parts of the document that elaborate on data analysis and reporting functionalities. The appendices 
                    provide supplementary material such as a glossary and TBD list, which supports all user groups in understanding 
                    the terminology and outstanding considerations. It's recommended that each user group begins with the overview 
                    sections before delving into the details most applicable to their responsibilities within the FCT ecosystem.

                <h3>1.4 Product Scope</h3>
                <p>
                    This application will provide anonymous feedback based on emotions according to the Plutchik model for various 
                    categories such as events, people, geographical places, products, services, etc.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Browsing the site allows users to access the posted feedback forms, create new anonymous (optional) ones and be able
                    to see and download statistics generated by the responses, categorised by specialists.
                    The generated reports will be available in HTML, CSV and JSON formats.
                </p> 
                <p>   
                    The product is designed, not only for normal users, but also for doctors and admins, making it possible to delete and 
                    add new forms in order to update and validate the information provided.

                <p>
                    For most pages, we were inspired by the Facebook Application, like the landing page which is the login page, but 
                    also for the posting feedback forms page. The main page was inspired by the Netflix home page, meaning the forms's 
                    movable line. The clean design was conceived by us, being influenced by the "white aesthetic" online trend.

                <p>
                    The web tool is predominantly dependent on two categories of hardware components for its operation: the web server 
                    and the user’s device. The server is tasked with hosting the application, storing, and managing the database which 
                    contains all the information pertinent to the feedback items and the collected responses. It handles the processing 
                    of user requests and serves the web pages that display the information in a user-friendly format. Communication 
                    between the client and the server is facilitated via the HTTP/HTTPS protocol, ensuring a standard and secure 
                    exchange of data. On the client side, any device equipped with a modern web browser, including but not limited to 
                    desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, is capable of accessing the web tool. This ensures that users can 
                    provide feedback from virtually any location and device, given that they have internet access.

                    <h4>3.3.1 Search engine</h4>
                    <p>
                        In terms of software technologies, the product is designed for the most used search engines such as Chrome, 
                        Opera, Mozilla or Edge and will use their services to access the website and to communicate with the server 
                        using the HTTP protocol.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The server implementation is done using Javascript as programming language, being a proprietary implementation
                        implementation. Its role is to access the database in order to complete the accessed web pages with the 
                        information required information. The web pages will be available in template format. The specific fields of 
                        each template are filled in with data received from the server and then loaded into the browser for the user 
                        to view.

                    <p>
                        The database used is Oracle Database. It will contain a table with available information as well as tags that 
                        can be applied at the time of filtering, specific to each feedback form (category). In addition to this table, 
                        there is also a table with information about the details of each form (title, description, data collection 
                        period, anonymity, owner, etc.), a table containing the validation of responses, a table of forms, a table with 
                        responses to forms and a table with encrypted information related to user login data.

                <h3>3.4 Communications Interfaces</h3>
                <p>
                    The HTTP protocol is the basis of communication between the site and the server. The search engine sends 
                    "HTTP Request" calls to the server, and receives "HTTP Response" signals from the server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Customer requests can be requests for information from the database (e.g. statistics related to form responses), 
                    or requests to write information to the database (e.g. registration of new users or forms in the database).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The server response consists of a set of data read from the database and sent to the page that made the request 
                    for display. These data sets are strings and contain information about the requested fields in the forms or the
                     addresses of the pictures displayed on the web pages.
